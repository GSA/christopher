Interested in all things digital in the federal government.  Often perplexed about the social side of computing and why it is hard to find product managers and UX/UI designers in the public space.  Exactly why government has gone digital under the guise of modernization to include end users and to produce products and code rapidly.  I am happy to be at the forefront of this effort and lead a great team in the process.

In my spare time, I can be found watching videos of past tech conferences for fun, walking around small towns with my kids looking for Pokemon, and out in the mountains for hours on my mountain bike.

My [bio]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/downloads/CastleBio.pdf) and CV (forthcoming) are works in progress as I continue my professional journey!
